ABSTRACT 
    Learning chemical bonds, especially an ionic bond, in grade 10 chemistry is an important part of 
developing your understanding of chemistry. Chemical bonds are basic knowledge of chemistry at the 
next level. However, the exercises provided in the book may be boring for some learners. Resulting in 
a lack of motivation to study, lack of enthusiasm for learning, and student learning outcomes will not 
be effective. Therefore, the author had an idea to develop an ionic bond puzzle game for Android 
smartphones. Ionic bond puzzle games can be easily accessed using smartphones. As a result, 
students easily understand ionic bonds and enjoy learning. Teachers can also use games as a medium 
to reinforce learning. It also encourages students to be interested in ionic bonds.
