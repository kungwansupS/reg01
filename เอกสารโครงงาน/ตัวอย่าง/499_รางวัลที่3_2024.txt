Conclusion
In a different subnet, the hybrid model uses less
computational time than the client-server model but takes
more time to obtain results.
In the same subnet, the hybrid model not only reduces
computational time compared to the client-server model but
also achieves faster results. However, when the number of
nodes is four, the differences are minimal.

Abstract
Introduction
    The Client-Server Model often faces limitations in communication efficiency when supporting many users. This independent study aims to
analyze the performance differences between the traditional client-server model and a hybrid model that utilizes a client agent to distribute
information to group members. 
    The simulation system is developed using the NS-3 network simulator, and it is devided to  sections:  creating a network simulation with
servers and clients in the same and different local networks, simulating network communication using TCP and UDP, selecting efficient
members for data transmission, and distributing tasks through client agents. 
    The test results indicate performance differences between the models, showing that the average delay from data generation to
transmission is less than 0.11 ms, the average delay from data generation to result reception exceeds 0.62 ms, the number of results received
within 1 second is below 420, and the average job size sent by the server is reduced by 24.34 bytes.
    Many users access online services, requiring fast, secure, and
scalable server performance. However, high user traffic increases
the server's workload beyond its capacity, leading to delays and
potential service failures.
Aims: Studying network communication and using the NS-3
Network Simulator to optimize server connection paths.
Proposed Solution: Redirecting communication through a user
representative in a group to reduce server workload.
